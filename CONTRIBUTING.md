## Getting Started

### Our Purpose

This repository's goal is to create a Discord bot for interacting with the Teslascope service via its available APIs.
Any pull requests, issues, or otherwise requests that stray away from this purpose may be rejected.

### Our Legal Commitment

As a company, Teslascope wishes to always be mindful and respectful of Tesla, Inc. While specific commands accessible via the Discord bot may not always interact directly with Tesla's servers, we ask that any additions or changes are respectful of their infrastructure whenever possible.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Bug Reports

Bugs can happen, and they usually make for a bad experience for everyone. Whenever a bug report is created, we will usually quickly act upon it, research the causes, and apply a fix when possible.
Bug Reports are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

### Feature Requests

Every single individual sees the world in a different light, and we're appreciative of those that can imagine creative ways to better or improve this Discord bot for everyone.
Feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

You may also request for new API endpoints to be added to our [Developer Documentation](https://teslascope.com/developer) as feature requests.

#### Making A Feature Request

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the request.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the feature** in as many details as possible.
* **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most Tesla vehicle owners and generally benefits the discord bot in some manner.

We believe in quality not quantity, so we prefer well thought-out features over creating many of them with limited functionality or usage.

### Pull Requests

We're thankful to each and every individual who has dedicated their time towards bettering our service, however with this in mind we have some requirements for pull requests to ensure a safe experience for every Discord user (and vehicle owner)!
